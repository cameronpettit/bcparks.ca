## Prerequisites

1. Make sure Strapi is running. Follow the steps found in ``src/cms/``
2. Copy ``.env.example`` as ``.env``.
  * ```REACT_APP_CMS_BASE_URL=http://localhost:1337``` must be set. Be sure your Strapi server is actually running on port ``1337``.

## Running local dev server

1. ``yarn``
2. ``yarn start``. This will run Gatsby in development mode.

You are able to create builds by running ``yarn build``.
